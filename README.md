This notebook implements the computational experiments in the paper below:

Guillermo Gallego \& Garrett van Ryzin (1994), ``Optimal Dynamic Pricing of 
Inventories with Stochastic Demand Over Finite Horizons", \textit{Management 
Science}, 40(8): 999-1020.

This is one of the early research papers in dynamic pricing. The authors focus 
on single item pricing problem in a finite horizon with constrained supply. 
In a later study in 1997, they focus on multiple products, which I will
implement later on.
